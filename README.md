## Technologies Used
- React Native: Our app is built using React Native, a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications. React Native allows us to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms, saving time and resources in development.

- Firebase: We leverage Firebase for various backend services such as authentication, real-time database, cloud messaging, and analytics. Firebase provides a scalable and reliable backend infrastructure, allowing us to focus on building features rather than managing servers.

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling our app's user interface. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and easy customization. With Tailwind CSS, we can quickly create consistent and visually appealing UI components across our app.

- Expo: Our development environment is powered by Expo, which streamlines the development process by providing tools for building, deploying, and testing React Native apps. Expo offers features like hot reloading, over-the-air updates, and access to native APIs, making app development more efficient and productive.
